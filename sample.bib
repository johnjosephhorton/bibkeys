 abstract = {Online markets reduce certain transaction costs related to global outsourcing. We focus on the role of verified work experience information in affecting online hiring decisions. Prior research shows that additional information about job applicants may disproportionately help or hinder disadvantaged populations. Using data from a major online contract labor platform, we find that contractors from less developed countries (LDCs) are disadvantaged relative to those from developed countries (DCs) in terms of their likelihood of being hired. However, we also find that although verified experience information increases the likelihood of being hired for all applicants, this effect is disproportionately large for LDC contractors. The LDC experience premium applies to other outcomes as well (wage bids, obtaining an interview, being shortlisted). Moreover, it is stronger for experienced employers, suggesting that learning is required to interpret this information. Finally, other platform tools (e.g., monitoring) partially substitute for the LDC experience premium; this provides additional support for the interpretation that the effect is due to information about experience rather than skills acquired from experience. We discuss implications for the geography of production and public policy.}

abstract={We empirically study the informational role of advertising in matching consumers with products when consumers are uncertain about both observable and unobserved program attributes. Our focus is on the network television industry, in which the products are television shows. We estimate a model that allows us to distinguish between the direct effect of advertising on utility and its effect through the information set. A notable behavioral implication is that exposure to informational advertising can decrease the consumer's tendency to purchase the promoted product. The structural estimates imply that an exposure to a single advertisement decreases the consumer's probability of not choosing her best alternative by approximately 10\%. Our results are relevant for industries characterized by product proliferation and horizontal differentiation.}

note={Copyright - Copyright Social Science Research Network Sep 2011; Last updated - 2012-10-09},
abstract={In a wide variety of economic contexts, collections of single-object auctions are used to allocate multiple substitutable goods. This paper studies how such collections of auctions aggregate into a multi-object auction market. We identify two features of auction-market design that enhance expected market efficiency: the individual auctions should be conducted in sequence, and information about all of the objects in the sequence should be revealed up front to the bidders. We then show that such an auction market is approximately efficient: specifically, its expected inefficiency is bounded above by the expected efficiency gain associated with adding one more bidder.}

journal={European Economic Review},
volume={52},

pages={150},
abstract={A number of papers in the theoretical auction literature show that the release of information regarding the seller's valuation of an item can cause bidders to bid more aggressively. This widely accepted result in auction theory remains largely untested in the empirical literature. Recent theoretical work has also shown that this effect can be more pronounced in auctions with larger common cost uncertainty. We examine the impact of a policy change by the Oklahoma Department of Transportation that led to the release of the state's internal estimate of the costs to complete highway construction projects. We perform a differences-in-differences analysis comparing bidding in Texas, a state that had a uniform policy of revealing the same information all throughout the period of analysis, to bidding in Oklahoma. Our results show that, in comparison to Texas auctions, the average bid in Oklahoma fell after the change in engineers' cost estimate (ECE) policy. This decline in bids was even larger for projects where the common uncertainty in costs is greater. Moreover, the within-auction standard deviation of bids fell after the change in ECE policy with the most significant decline observed again in projects with greater common cost uncertainty.}

pages={1325},
abstract={Policies that reduce asymmetry of information will increase the liquidity of the market for a firm's securities. This induces large institutional traders who anticipate making future large trades to take larger current positions. The reduced information asymmetry increases the competition with market makers and reduces the volatility of future order imbalances, leading to exit of market makers. This exit of market makers increases the temporary component of future security returns. If the firm is large enough, then to have a low cost of capital, it must attract large positions from institutional investors. In addition, for any fixed amount of information asymmetry, a large firm will have larger order imbalances because the equilibrium holdings of large traders subject to liquidity shocks are increasing in the size of the firm. For smaller firms, institutional investors will choose smaller positions, leading to smaller trades if they liquidate and to lower compensation to market makers.}

abstract={An empirical investigation of adverse selection in the wholesale used car market is presented. New car dealers (who sell both new and used cars) differ from used car dealers (who sell only used cars) in the propensity to sell trade-ins on the wholesale market. Models of adverse selection suggest that the dealer type that sells a higher proportion of its trade-ins on the wholesale market will sell, on average, cars of higher quality and receive in return a higher price. A survey of dealers' wholesale behavior and prices collected at a wholesale auction are used to test this prediction. Weak evidence is found for adverse selection.}}

abstract={The efficient capital market hypothesis (ECMH) has achieved wide acceptance by the legal community. ECMH predicts that, even though information is not immediately and costlessly available to all participants, the market will act as if it were. An explanation is proposed of the elements that lead to and limit market efficiency. Two theoretical problems are examined: 1. the role of investment bankers in achieving market efficiency, and 2. the persistence of an efficient market response to information even though traders must earn a return on their investment in information. The way in which the capital and information markets jointly operate to determine the relative efficiency of securities prices is explained. A continuum of market mechanisms oriented toward trading information distribution can be a tool for understanding markets and their institutional supports.}}

We show that the grade cards cause (i) restaurant health inspection scores to increase, (ii) consumer demand to become sensitive to changes in restaurants' hygiene quality, and (iii) the number of foodborne illness hospitalizations to decrease. We also provide evidence that this improvement in health outcomes is not fully explained by consumers substituting from poor hygiene restaurants to good hygiene restaurants. These results imply that the grade cards cause restaurants to make hygiene quality improvements.},

abstract={We propose a framework for analyzing transformations of demand. Such transformations frequently stem from changes in the dispersion of consumers' valuations, which lead to rotations of the demand curve. In many settings, profits are a U-shaped function of dispersion. High dispersion is complemented by niche production, and low dispersion is complemented by mass-market supply. We investigate numerous applications, including product design; advertising, marketing and sales advice; and the construction of quality-differentiated product lines. We also suggest a new taxonomy of advertising, distinguishing between hype, which shifts demand, and real information, which rotates demand.}

abstract={An experiment analyzing behavior in English common values auctions is reported. English auctions raise more revenue than first-price auctions only when bidders do not suffer from a strong winner's curse. Agents employ other bidders' drop-out prices along with their private information as Nash bidding theory predicts. However, a simple and natural signal-averaging rule, that does not require recognizing the adverse-selection effect of winning the auction, better characterizes the data than the Nash rule. Monte Carlo simulations using FIML estimates of the signal-averaging rule predict a number of data characteristics not directly employed in the estimation procedure.}

abstract={Since Akerlof (1970), economists have understood the adverse selection problem that information asymmetries can create in used goods markets. The remarkable growth in online used goods auctions thus poses a puzzle. Part of the solution is that sellers voluntarily disclose their private information on the auction web page. This defines a precise contract - to deliver the car shown for the closing price - which helps protect the buyer from adverse selection. I test this theory using data from eBay Motors, finding that online disclosures are important price determinants, and that disclosure costs impact both the level of disclosure and prices.}

A device for modeling ''good news'' is introduced and applied to 4 simple models. In the equilibria of these models: 1. Good news about a firm's prospects always causes its share price to rise. 2. More favorable evidence of an agent's effort leads the principal to pay a larger bonus. 3. Buyers expect any product information withheld by a salesman is unfavorable to his product. 4. Bidders assume low bids by their competitors signal a low value for the object being sold. The ``more favorable than'' relation and the related ideas developed make analysis of these models and interpretation of the results easier.}

Also, when bidders are risk-neutral, the second-price auction generates higher average prices than the Dutch and first-price auctions. In all of these auctions, the seller can raise the expected price by adopting a policy of providing expert appraisals of the quality of the objects he sells.}

Title = {Electronic and Physical Market Channels: A Multiyear Investigation in a Market for Products of Uncertain Quality.},
Volume = {55},
Year = {2009},
Abstract = {Many markets that have traditionally relied on collocation of buyers, sellers, and products have introduced electronic channels. Although these electronic channels may provide benefits to buyers and sellers by lowering the transaction costs of participating in the market, there are trade-offs related to quality uncertainty and increased risk that may limit the adoption of the electronic channels. As a result, buyers and sellers use physical channels for some transactions and electronic channels for others. These usage patterns may evolve over time, particularly when the electronic channels are new. We examine buyer and seller use of electronic and physical channels in a market for products of uncertain quality (used vehicles) over a 2.5-year period. Results indicate that transactions involving low quality uncertainty and relatively rare products occurred in the electronic channels, whereas transactions involving high quality uncertainty and relatively plentiful products.}

power. However, if failing firms exit, new entry may limit remaining firms' market power if there
are potential entrants who can be as effective competitors as the firms leaving the market. We quantify
these effects in the case of the 1984 bailout of timber companies that faced substantial losses on existing
federal timber contracts. We predict that the bailout substantially increased sale prices in subsequent
auctions because firms that might have might have been induced to enter without the bailout tended 
to have relatively low values.}}
